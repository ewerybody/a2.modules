# VolumeControl

Hotkeys for Sound Volume control.

### Volume Up/Down <kbd>Win+Alt+WheelUp/Down</kbd>

Lower or Raise the **master** sound volume.

### Step

Sets the amount of steps taken on the volume scale used by the Volume Up/Down hotkets.

### Toggle Mute

Sets the audio mute state On or Off according to the current state.

This one currently has no default key. If you have a good idea about what key to take for this by default, I'd like to hear about it! [file a **VolumeControl** issue](https://github.com/ewerybody/a2.modules/issues/new?labels=mod%3AVolumeControl)

Thanks!
