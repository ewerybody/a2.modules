# WindowControl

### Hotkeys for general window management.

### Minimize Window <kbd>Win+RButton</kbd>

Minimizes the Window under your mouse pointer. That's why the default is on <kbd>Windows+Right-Click</kbd>.

### Maximize Window toggle <kbd>Win+Up</kbd>

Executes Maximize/Restore on the currently active window according the the current maximize state.

### Toggle Always-On-Top <kbd>Win+Home</kbd>

Toggles the current "Keep-in-Foreground" state (aka Always-On-Top) and shows a tooltip with the status.

## remarks

This is supposed to be port of the very omnipotent **WindowsControl** from ac'tivAid back in the days by [Wolfgang Reszel](https://github.com/Tekl) and Jack Tissen. Sadly there has not been much time to perform the whole porting and only some few functions are available here. But some functionality actually moved into Windows built-in functions. We still lack the complete overview there and any help collecting things is much appreciated!
