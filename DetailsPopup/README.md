* Have a menu popup with things to be pasted on <kbd>Left Click</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd>/<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
* Each selection removes the item from current list until all is pasted or canceled.
* "**Finish after first selected item**" ends the pasting process already when one item was pasted.
* Import/Export data via JSON files from the Module menu.
