# gtranslate

### Make small text translation requests with your active selection.

### Translate Anything shortcut <kbd>RAlt+RShift+L</kbd>

Gives you a menu with
* your enlisted translations from the list in the gtranslate main UI
* a expandable submenu with ALL the 109 supported languages
* the last selected language from the submenu if any

Selecting from the submenu or the last used will request a translation from ANY language aka `auto` to the selected language. For example `auto > en` for any language to english.

### Translation list

Use the list in the gtranslate main UI to Add or Remove `from > to` language presets that you can also equip with a **dedicated hotkey**.
Here **Detect Language (auto)** is preselected which will try to translate anything to your desired target language.

### ☑ Use Proxy
Check this to make it try use the proxy settings from the **main a2 ui advanced tab**.

### ☑ Ask me before translating a website
When selecting a URL gtranslate would try to bring you to a tranalated version of the urls website. You might want to translate the actual words in the URL though. This will ask you before doing either.
