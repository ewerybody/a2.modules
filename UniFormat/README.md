# UniFormat

### Find and Replace in selected text with sets from the huge unicode repository.

Docs `WIP`

usage:
* Select some text
* press Main UniFormat hotkey (default <kbd>Win+Shift+U</kbd>)
* select a set
* 𝓥𝓸𝓲𝓵𝓪!

Set up a "**Format with ... directly**" hotkey to apply that set directly to a selection without any more steps.

The **տiCr㎲h** set is basically [htwins's **Unicrush**](https://htwins.net/unicrush) ported to an a2 Autohotkey module. Lots of Kudos! 🙇‍♀️
In fact **this WHOLE thing** went off from the Unicrush idea and extrapolated to an arbitrary number of sets for finding/replacing.
This isn't even constrained to Unicode at all! One could set up any list of strings to find with strings to be replaced ... (maybe find swear words and replace them with emojis or whatever ...)
Making the huge amount of untapped latin unicode characters more accessible was just the most fun application. Sure lets do more!

For suggestions or bug reports please [file a **UniFormat** issue](https://github.com/ewerybody/a2.modules/issues/new?labels=mod%3AUniFormat). Thank you!
