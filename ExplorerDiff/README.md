# ExplorerDiff

### Easy diffing in the Windows Explorer.

* Default Hotkey <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd>. (Overrides "Delete" ...)
* Set a "Diff application path". For instance
  [`C:\Program Files\WinMerge\WinMergeU.exe`](https://winmerge.org/downloads/)
* Select a pair of files of folders and press the hotkey. Voil√†
* press the hotkey on Windows Explorer without having a file selected:
  Selects the Folder as first path and waits for you to select another one.
* press hotkey in one Explorere, goto another one and press again
  to diff the two files without fiddling with dialogs.
