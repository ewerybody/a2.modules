### Make selected text UPPER/lower case <kbd>Alt+Shift+Up</kbd>/<kbd>Alt+Shift+Down</kbd>

With some text selected turn lower case letters into uppercase ones and vide-versa and try to reselect.
* `some lower` <kbd>Alt+Shift+Up</kbd> `SOME LOWER`
* `sOmE UpP3R` <kbd>Alt+Shift+Down</kbd> `some upp3r`

## Ideas welcome!
Apparently this lacks quite some things that the original ac'tivAid "TextAid" provided. If there is interest in having more of these ported or any other new ideas and suggestions: Please [just open an issue](https://github.com/ewerybody/a2.modules/issues/new?labels=mod%3AtexTools) and let's chat about it!
