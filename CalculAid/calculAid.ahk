; nice :/ on win10 although you call calc.exe the calculator process executable will be:
; "ApplicationFrameHost.exe" and the class: "ApplicationFrameWindow". Thanks MS! This can be
; ANYTHING!!! OK the title is still "Calculator" but only on an english system.
; So basically we need logic for all of that because nothing
; is for sure. Furthermore that also means that the Close-hetkeys we wanna setup in a2ui will need
; win-version and language specific scope identifyers. In the end such a function will be quite
; nice to have in a2 anyway.

calculAid_open() {
    tt("CalculAid...", 1)
    global calculAid_openAtCursor, calculAid_AlwaysOnTop
