# ExplorerHotkeys

### Some extra shortcuts for your Windows Filebrowser.

This one was partially ported from the original ac'tivAid ExplorerHotkeys bt [Wolfgang Reszel](https://github.com/Tekl).

* ### Call Explorer with a predefined path <kbd>Win+E</kbd>
  The standard "Open Explorer" shortcut brings you to the "This PC" space,
  well here you can **override** that with any directory you please.
  
* ### Toggle Hidden Items <kbd>Ctrl+H</kbd>
  Turns the visibility of **Hidden Items** on/off accordinhg to the current state.
  
  This is usually a little buried in the Ribbon. And if you don't have the Ribbon showing. I'd be <kbd>Alt</kbd>, <kbd>V</kbd>, <kbd>HH</kbd> ...  
  Now this one you can have at whatever shortcut.
  
  Note: There is an issue when the Toggling is not visually happening. This might happen when the main file item box of the Explorere dos NOT hava focus.
  The toggling happens in the background tho!
