With options to
* **Allow Resizing Fixed Windows** - (handle with care! Some windows have locked sizes for good reasons)
* **Resize Focused Windows Only / Move Inactive Ones** - makes only active windows work with the 9 zones. Not currently focussed ones will only have "one" region: for moving.
* **Show Tooltip** - during move or resize operation with stats
* **Make is use a Raster while holding <b><kbd>Shift</kbd></b> key** - 
* **Maximize on Doubleclick** - according to the 9 regions: left/right regions: maximize horizontaly, top/bottom region: maximize vertically, center: maximize whole window.
  This also **toggles** the maximization in the according regions.

This one was partially ported from the original ac'tivAid ComfortResize by Bernd Schandl, [Wolfgang Reszel](https://github.com/Tekl), [Michael Telgkamp](https://telgkamp.de).
